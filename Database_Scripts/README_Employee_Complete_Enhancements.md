2. Build the application to ensure no compilation errors
3. Test the functionality thoroughly

### 3. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new employee with all fields populated
- [ ] Upload and verify employee photo
- [ ] Test salary calculation functionality
- [ ] Edit an existing employee and verify all fields
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Verify modal displays all information correctly
- [ ] Test photo preview functionality
- [ ] Confirm data is saved correctly in database

## File Structure

### New Files Created:
- `Database_Scripts/Add_Employee_Financial_Fields.txt` - Database schema updates

### Salary Calculation Formula:
```
Salary After Increase = Current Salary + (Current Salary Ã— Annual Increase Percentage / 100)
```

## Conclusion

The Employee management system has been successfully enhanced to provide comprehensive employee information management, including personal details, financial information, photo uploads, and license requirements. The system now matches the functionality and user experience of the ControllerUser management system while maintaining backward compatibility and data integrity.

All enhancements have been implemented with proper error handling, validation, and user experience considerations. The system is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
